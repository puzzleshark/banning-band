# Banning Band

Three siblings united by blood and a shared love for the golden age of jazz. We bring the intimate, smoky atmosphere of vintage lounge music to life with our interpretations of classics from Chet Baker, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and the great American songbook.

Our sound captures the sophisticated simplicity of jazz vocals and piano trio arrangements - think dimly lit clubs, crisp martinis, and the timeless romance of standards that never go out of style.
